That's the feeling lock Scott Barrett, 45 Tests, has ahead of the game. The South Americans, who have endured more obstacles than any of their Championship opponents in arriving at the tournament, have not scored a point against the All Blacks in the two outings since last year's triumph when winning their first Test against them.
That would add to the desperation they brought to the Test. They'll look at their tape and present different pictures. They'll probably turn up with a little more of an edge he said. But while the Pumas would be looking to get better, so would the All Blacks."),
